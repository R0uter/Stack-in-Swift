## Stack class for Swift
I found that swift does not had Stack in stdlib(?)

So I try to implement that for my self.

###Use

Anyway, there is two version of Stack: 

`StackG` is Generic version Stack.It uses struct;

`Stack` is class version Stack,It seems more like common Stack,which needs to check the type of value before you use it.

###Demo

See `see main.swift`.
